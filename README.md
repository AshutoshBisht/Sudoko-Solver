# Sudoko-Solver

## Intoduction
   In this project i have created a sudoko solver by the method of back tracking.Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique 
   for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions
   that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time (by time, here, is referred to the time elapsed till
   reaching any level of the search tree).
    
### Language Used
   C++
    
### How to run on your system:
   C++ is a compiled language meaning your program's source code must be translated (compiled) before it can be run on your computer. 
   Some platforms, such as Linux or macOS, have a C++ compiler already installed. Most Linux distributions have the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 
   installed and macOS users can get the Clang tools with XCode.
   If you don't have a compiler installed, in the example below, we describe how to install the Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW) C++ tools
   (compiler and debugger). MinGW is a popular, free toolset for Windows.
    
   You can use any IDE that you prefer.
   
   You can check the following to run c++ code on your pc using Visual studio code:
